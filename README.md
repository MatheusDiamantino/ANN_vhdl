# Super Neural Network
Implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on FPGA using VHDL.

The ANN is able to perform the detection of logical operations, such as XOR, AND, OR... although it could to be expanded to some more complex models.

Implements both feedforward and backpropagation. The project can be summarized as below:
